These are 18 backgrounds for cameos, based on Naboo, from Star Wars: Episode 1. Not all are from film scenes, in fact, most are from Star Wars: Battle For Naboo, the game.

Lastly i recommend two things:

1- The backgrounds are 24-bit depth, so you can 8-bit em whatever way you want
2- For gods sake, DO NOT BUT Battle For Naboo, IT SUCKS. Try Rogue Squadron instead.
